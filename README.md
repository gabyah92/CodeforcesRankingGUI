Hello everyone!

I have created this project overnight to scrape rankings from Codeforces for my batch in **CMRIT** and through my consultancy **Pyramid**.

The first input box accepts tokens, which can be used to scrape codeforces handles by multiple tokens separated by Comma's. Useful when scraping results for a set of people having the same token name in their handle. EX : CMRIT25_HallTicketNumber.

The Excel sheet will be generated in the same directory as the jar file, in a folder called Leaderboards.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
